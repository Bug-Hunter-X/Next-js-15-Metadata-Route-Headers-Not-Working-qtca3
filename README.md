# Next.js 15 Metadata Route Headers Not Working

This issue demonstrates a problem where custom headers defined in a Next.js 15 `metadata` route are not being added to the response.  The provided code snippet shows a simple `metadata` route that attempts to add a custom header, but this header does not appear in the actual response. 

This repository contains two files: `metadata.js` (the buggy code) and `metadataSolution.js` (the corrected code).  The bug is described in detail within the JSON.
